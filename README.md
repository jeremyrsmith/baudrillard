# baudrillard

Is it a program, or a type? In the end, maybe what's the difference?

This is the research project around symbolic functions that I demonstrated at ScalaDays 2019.
It's pretty rough right now, but you can go in and see how it all works. Not everything is
implemented, but I'll clean it up a bit soon (and write some actual documentation) â€“ I wanted
to get it posted in case anyone (everyone?) was confused by the slides that I rushed through.

[Here's the slides for now](https://jeremyrsmith.github.io/baudrillard/slides/)
